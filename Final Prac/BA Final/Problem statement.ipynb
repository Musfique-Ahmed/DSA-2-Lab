    "---------\n",
    "There are **23** students and **80** pairs of friends in the DSA2 lab section BA. Friendships are bidirectional, meaning if student A is friends with student B, then B is also friends with A. Each friendship has a strength value, representing the effort required to pass a message between two friendsâ€”the stronger the friendship, the less effort needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Farhan Tariq Jamee wants to send a secret message to every other student in the class using the minimum total effort. However, some students are considered \"snitches\" and will reveal the secret to the faculty. A student is identified as a snitch if their name contains the substring 'na'. Each student has a unique name, and while passing messages, Jamee must avoid any path that includes a snitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to help Jamee determine the minimum total effort required to send the secret message to all students in the class, ensuring that the message is never passed through a snitch."
